# Description
    For this project, I'd like to create a music player that will play mp3's from a specified folder. 
# Features
    The music player will play & pause a song, skip to the next song, return to the previous song, and display the name, artist & artwork of the song playing. 
# Challenges
    For this project, I will need to learn how to make use of Tkinker in Python. 
# Outcomes
## Ideal Outcome
    Ideally, the music player will be able to play & pause a song, skip to the next song, return to the previous song, display the name, artist, artwork, & duration of the song playing, with an aesthetically pleasing GUI, themed to the songs in the playlist. 
## Minimal Viable Outcome
    # The "bare essentialls" of this project would involve being able to play & pause the song playing, skip the currently playing song, and return to the previous song, as well as displaying the name. 
# Milestones
    I think that some of the milestones would include: designing the indivudal assets for the GUI; getting access to a specified playlist of songs; implemepting the ability to play and pause a song; implementing the ablity to skip and return to a song; displaying a song's name and duration; etc.
